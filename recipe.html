                    Nobody wants their cake to stick to the pan, so it's important to prep your pans before pouring in the batter.<br>
                     With the exception of angel food and chiffon cakes, most recipes call for greasing and flouring<br>
                     the pan or lining the pan with waxed or parchment paper.<br><br>
                     As for knowing what type of baking pan to use, our Test Kitchen prefers shiny pans for achieving a golden appearance.<br>
                      If you use a dark or dull-finish pan, reduce the oven temperature by 25°F and check doneness<br>
                       3 to 5 minutes early to prevent overbrowning.<br>

                    Many recipes require cake ingredients such as eggs and butter to stand at room temperature.<br>
                     This allows the butter to blend easily with other ingredients and the eggs will yield a higher cake volume.<br>
                      (For food safety reasons, don't leave the eggs at room temperature for more time than specified in the recipe.)<br></br>

                        When a cake bakes too quickly it can develop tunnels and cracks, too slowly and it can be coarse.<br>
                         Let your oven preheat for at least 10 minutes, and use an oven thermometer ($7, Target) to make sure it reaches the proper temperature.<br>
                          If you're using dark cake pans, you'll want to reduce the oven temperature called for in your recipe by 25°F.<br>

                     Rather than adding each dry ingredient individually to the batter, whisk ($6, Walmart) them together in a bowl beforehand.<br>
                      That way you know the ingredients are equally distributed throughout the batter.<br>

                    Wondering how to make a cake with a light, airy crumb? <br>
                    Creaming butter and sugar is the most important step. Here's how:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using an electric mixer ($23, Target) on medium to high speed, beat the butter for 30 seconds.<br>
                             Generally, a stand mixer requires a medium speed for this step and a hand mixer requires a higher speed.<br>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Add eggs (or egg whites) one at a time, beating well after each.<br> 
                        Their protein creates structure around air bubbles to maintain texture.<br>

                            <dd> Break eggs individually into a custard cup or small bowl first. This way if you get shell fragments,<br>
                                 you can easily fish them out of the cup rather than try to get them out of the batter.</dd>

                                Divide the batter evenly between the baking pans. Use an offset spatula ($9, Bed Bath & Beyond) to spread the batter in an even layer.<br>
                                 Be sure to spread it to the pan edge. Bake your cake according to your recipe's directions.<br>

                                Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack ($15, Walmart) for 10 minutes maximum. <br>
                                To remove from the pans, run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen it from the sides.<br>
                                 Place a wire rack over the top of the cake and flip the pan. Lift the pan off the cake, being careful not to tear the edges of the cake.<br>
                                  If you used waxed or parchment paper, gently peel the paper off the cake.<br><br>
